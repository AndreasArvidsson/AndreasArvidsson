### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer who codes only by voice and spend my time building tools primarily for voice control, like [Cursorless](https://www.cursorless.org). Beside programming I have a passion for audio and sound reproduction which led me to develop my own digital sound processor: [WinDSP](https://github.com/AndreasArvidsson/WinDSP) that has been the brain of my home theatre system for years. 

If you like to talk about voice control join [Talon slack](https://talonvoice.slack.com) and if you like to support my work please consider [sponsoring me](https://github.com/sponsors/AndreasArvidsson) :blush:
